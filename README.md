# FIRMS-Ukraine-Mapper


## Project Description

This project is an interactive timelapse of NASA FIRMS events occurring throughout the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine. NASAâ€™s FIRMS system
tracks and stores global fire data in a large, publicly available archive. FIRMS can either be natural or man-made, such as rocket or artillery strikes, making FIRMS an ideal tool for analyzing the war in Ukraine. The hope is that by tracking fire data over time, the user will be able to get a general idea of where the most intense fighting is currently taking place and how the frontlines have changed over the course of the conflict.

## Running the project

The project can be run by running the main.py file.

## Required modules

This project uses the cmu_graphics module to render the UI and the pandas module for reading FIRMS data.
